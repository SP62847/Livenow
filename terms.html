Welcome to Velocity Apex!</h3><p>By playing the games on the Velocity Apex website (the "Service"), you and your parent or guardian agree to these rules ("Terms"). If you don't agree with the rules, you shouldn't use the Service. Make sure to read these with a grown-up!</p></div><div class='card'><h3>2. Playing Our Games</h3><p>Our games are for your personal, non-commercial fun only. You agree to play nicely and not try to cheat, break the games, or use them for anything mean or illegal. Just have fun and be a good sport!</p></div><div class='card'><h3>3. Our Games and Content</h3><p>All the games, art, characters, and music belong to Velocity Apex. You can't use them for your own projects or business without asking for our permission first. They are our special creations for you to enjoy!</p></div><div class='card'><h3>4. Ending Your Playtime</h3><p>We can stop you from using our Service if you break the rules. We hope we never have to do this!</p></div><div class='card'><h3>5. Our Promise</h3><p>Our games are provided "AS IS," which means we offer them for fun but can't promise they will be perfect. We do our best to make them awesome, but sometimes things might not work exactly right. Playing our games is at your own risk.</p></div><div class='card'><h3>6. Responsibility</h3><p>Velocity Apex and its team are not responsible for any problems that might happen from playing our games. We're all about fun, and we're not liable for any issues that come up.</p></div><div class='card'><h3>7. The Rules of the Land</h3><p>These rules are based on the laws of the place where our company is located. If there's ever a serious disagreement, those are the laws we'll follow.</p></div><div class='card'><h3>8. Changing the Rules</h3><p>We might change these rules sometimes. If we do, we'll post the new ones here. By continuing to play our games, you agree to the new rules. So check back with a parent every so often!</p></div></section><footer class="footer"><div class="container" style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:space-between;gap:12px;flex-wrap:wrap">
